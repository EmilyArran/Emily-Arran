# Emily-Arran

I am a highly motivated and competent individual. I have exceptional organisational skills, with the ability to work both independently, as part of and as a leader of a team. During my successful career in education, I was challenged to create a project that could be used to enhance A Level teaching across multiple subjects. As a result, I developed an idea to create an app which would gamify revision for A Level students. Subsequently, due to the pandemic and an increased move to online teaching, this provided me with an opportunity to attend online courses on software development. As my passion for software developing grew, I decided to take a break from my career in education to be able to be fully engrossed in developing my skills. I am really eager to learn more and have the ability to contribute to a fast-paced, innovative company.
